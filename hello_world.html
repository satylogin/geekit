				<h4> HELLO WORLD! </h4>
				<p>
					Let us write our first program in C language. The problem is the classic hello world problem.<br>
				</p>

				<div id = "code">
					#include <stdio.h><br><br>

					int main()<br>
					{<br>
						<span style = "margin-left:40px;">printf("HELLO WORLD!\n");</span><br><br>

						<span style = "margin-left:40px;">return 0;</span><br>
					}<br>
				</div>

				<p>
					<h4>To Execute</h4>
					Go on and write the above code in the editor. compile and run the code.<br>
					For linux users, type ctrl + alt + t to open the terminal. Then type vi hello_world.c.<br>
					This will open up a new file called hello_world.c <br>
					hello_world is the name of the file and .c is the extension that tells the compiler that this file is
					a c program source code.<br>
					press i to start typing, i stands for insert mode.
					type the following code in the file.
					to save and exit, press esc. Then type ":x" and then enter. Now you have saved and exit.<br>
					To compile the code, type gcc hello_world.c. This will compile the code. <br>
					Now the final step, type ./a.out to run your program.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<p>
					<h4>Let us Disect</h4>
					#include <stdio.h> :<br>
					This means that we are telling the compiler to include a header file called stdio.h (.h means header)
					which has functions like scanf and printf that helps us to take input and give output. We will include 
					a seperate article on #include.<br><hr>

					int main() {      } :<br>
					every c function must have a main function. This is the place from where the file starts to execute.
					int means the return type of the function. int is a data type. We will add another article on data 
					types in c. : <br><hr>

					return 0; : <br>
					This is the return value of the function. It means what the function returns to the calling function. <br>

					For now just memorise that these will always be in your c program, no matter whatever program you are making.

					<hr><br>
					And finally printf("HELLO WORLD\n") : <br>
					It says to print the string HELLO WORLD on screen.<br>
					\n Stands for new line. <br><hr>

					It will be easy to write code if you memorise these steps. With time as you will read further, you will understand
					these things in more detail. And it gives you a little bit of confidence if you are able to write code.<hr>
